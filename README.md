hey! 

The project would be around creating a personal portfolio website of a HND Digital design & development student, focused on the digital design and the web-development and previous works as well  creating a whole branding project to back up the portfolio ( logo, style-guide, assetsâ€¦). Ideally the project would reflect in an accurate way the core values and work ethic of the person ideally we would create a dynamic and visually appealing digital portfolio that showcases your skills, projects, and achievements in the field of digital design and development
